        description: "This delicious Nicaraguan puro features an oily, mouthwatering Corojo maduro wrapper and it is packed with tobaccos from this Central American country’s prime tobacco growing regions. When lit, the Devil’s Hand offers a flavorful, medium to full-bodied smoking experience. The Devil’s Hand is the first time Esteban Carreras has used Corojo tobacco in one of its cigars. The cigar got its curious name from the premium Corojo seeds that were smuggled out of Cuba. The “devil” being Fidel Castro and his government."
